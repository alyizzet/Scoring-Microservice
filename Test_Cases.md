<h2> Test Cases </h2>

1. User Input is not Int32.(GameId, UserId, Score)
2. User Input is out-of bounds(There are 5 games in this example case, so when GameId > 5 it is out of bounds.)
3. User Input Score is more than 100 and less than 0.
4. Normally if you are using a test database you should test it too. Especially for Authentication Databases. I have included sample tests in the tests folder.
